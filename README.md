# ROCPP
## Introduction
ROC++ is a C++ based platform for modeling, automatically reformulating, and solving robust optimization problems. 

ROC++ can address both single- and multi-stage problems involving exogenous and/or endogenous uncertain parameters and real- and/or binary-valued adaptive variables. 

Please visit our [website](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/robust-opt-cpp/home) for more detailed information.

## How to use
### Dependencies
ROC++ requires at least one of the following MILP solvers:
* [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/)
* [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/)
	* Note that SCIP needs at leaset one LP solver, the supported LP solver interfaces are listed [here](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/LPI.php).
	* If you want to solve a nonlinear MIP porblem, you need to have at least one of [NLP solver](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/NLPISOLVERS.php) supported by SCIP.
	* The compilation instructions of SCIP are [here](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/CMAKE.php) using CMake and [here](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/MAKE.php) using Makefiles.

### Compile
After installation of the solvers, we can build the ROCPP project using CMake by following steps:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DEXAMPLE=EXAMPLE_NAME .. [-DSOLVER=SOLVER_NAME -DGUROBI_DIR=/path/to/gurobi]
make
```

CMake will build files in a separated directory. Users need to create this directory, usually called `build` or whatever other names. Then run `cmake -DEXAMPLE=EXAMPLE_NAME .. [-DSOLVER=SOLVER_NAME -DGUROBI_DIR=/path/to/gurobi]` to configure the build. The option `EXAMPLE` indicates the example to run. `SOLVER` set the solver to use. If you choose GUROBI as the solver, you need to specify the path to gurobi to `GUROBI_DIR`. The following table lists detailed information on CMake options.

Next, run `make` to compile the source code. You can the generated executable can be found in `bin`. In macOS, you need to give the system permission to run the executable.

|CMake Options|type    |Avaliable values|Description|
|:-----------:|:------:|:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|EXAMPLE      |string|BB, RSFC, PB    |Name of the example to run in the folder `/examples`, can also be the names of users created .cpp files|
|SOLVER       |string|GUROBI, SCIP    |Name of the solvers that are supported by ROCPP, SCIP by default|
|GUROBI_DIR   |path  |-               |Path to the folder which contains the Gurobi libraries and include folder|
